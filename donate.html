  <p>  At Code for San José, civic tech means so much more than helping communities understand and navigate local government. </p>

  <p>  It also means working harder than ever to reach more people and communities.</p>

  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://secure.codeforamerica.org/page/contribute/default?brigade=CodeforSanJose" role="button">Donate Now!</a></p> 

  <p>Your generous gift will support our renewed efforts to connect to all of San José through hosting biweekly community meetings, as well as events like the National Day of Civic Hacking.  Your donation funds:</p>

    <li>Business cards and Stickers</li>
