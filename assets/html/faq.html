                        No, you do not need to know coding to participate. 
                        There are many ways to contribute non-technical skills, 
                        e.g. user research, design, blogging, social media, onboarding volunteers, 
                        event organizing, fundraising, etc.

                        How did Code for San Jose begin?

                        In March 2014, [Kalen Gallagher]
                        (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalengallagher) and [Michelle Thong]
                        (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mthong) co-founded Code for San Jose, a 
                        local Code for America brigade. We are a group of volunteers who are 
                        passionate about using our skills to advance civic innovation in San Jose. 
                        Our members represent a range of skill sets and interests, spanning the 
                        high tech, local government and non-profit sectors.

                    <h3>
                        What is a Code for America Brigade?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        A Code for America Brigade is a group of volunteers who meet regularly 
                        to collaborate on technology, data, policy and design projects that 
                        strengthen their communities. There are over 30 Brigades in the United 
                        States. Brigades build participatory power in their cities by holding regular 
                        civic hack nights, advocating for open data, and deploying apps.
                        <p>
                            Local brigades determine their own activities and projects, and the overall 
                            Brigade program is administered by Code for America, a San Francisco-based 
                            non-profit organization. Code for America has a range of other programs that 
                            help governments, entrepreneurs and residents harness technology to solve community 
                            problems, including a one-year Fellowship, a civic start-up Accelerator and Incubator 
                            and the Peer Network for government workers.

                    <h3>
                        What is Civic Hacking?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Civic hacking is when citizens see something in the public realm that they can make better, 
                        and they take it upon themselves to create a solution.
                        <p>
                            A civic hacker can be anyone – technologist, public servant, designer, entrepreneur, 
                            engineer – who is willing to collaborate with others to address local challenges and 
                            make their cities better for everyone. 
                            <p>
                                A hacker is someone who uses a minimum of resources and a maximum of brainpower and 
                                ingenuity to create, enhance or fix something. Although in some circumstances the term 
                                is used in a negative sense, the term is not inherently negative, nor does it even have 
                                to be related to technology.
                            </p>

                    <h3>
                        What is Open Data?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone. The U.S. government 
                        defines open data as publicly available data structured in a way that enables the data to be fully 
                        discoverable and usable by end users.
                        <p>
                            Governments around the US are opening their data, allowing civic hackers to build tools, apps and 
                            other solutions that benefit their communities.

                    <h3>
                        What is Open Govermnet?
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Open government promotes greater citizen participation, collaboration, and transparency in government. 
                        This includes promoting government accountability via improved citizen access to public government 
                        information, decision-making, and representatives.
                        <p>
                            Many public agencies already abide by open government laws that were developed in the 1970s prior 
                            to the Internet. These laws tend to be focused on making sure meetings are held in public and that 
                            agencies respond to requests for information.
                            <p>
                                Today, open government increasingly overlaps with the idea that governments should provide 
                                citizens with open data on its actions, performance and decisions.
