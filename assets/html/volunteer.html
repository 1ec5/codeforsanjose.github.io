    <h2>Before you join...</h2>
    <div class="text-content codeOfConduct">
      <p>
        Every member is expected to <span>read and abide by</span> both our Code of Conduct
        and Anti-Harassment policy. <span>Please read them both
          carefully.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is adapted from Code for America's Code of Conduct and
        Anti-Harassment Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>
        The Code for San Jose community expects that Code for San Jose network
        activities, events, and digital forums:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Are a <span>safe</span> and <span>respectful</span> environment for all participants.</li>
        <li>Are a place where people are free to <span>
            fully express their
            identities
          </span>.</li>
        <li><span>Presume the value of others</span>. Everyone's ideas, skills, and
          contributions have value.</li>
        <li><span>Don't assume everyone has the same context</span>, and encourage
          questions.</li>
        <li>Find a way for people to be <span>productive</span> with their skills <span>
            (technical
            and not)
          </span> and energy. Use language such as <span>"yes/and,"</span> not "no/but."</li>
        <li><span>Encourage</span> members and participants to <span>listen</span> as much as they speak.</li>
        <li>Strive to build tools that are <span>
            open and free technology for public
            use</span>.</li>
        <li><span>Prioritize access</span> for and input from those who are <span>
            traditionally
            excluded from the civic process</span>.</li>
        <li>Work to ensure that the community is <span>well-represented</span> in the
          planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes
          <span>encouraging participation</span> from <span>
            women, minorities, and traditionally
            marginalized groups
          </span>.</li>
        <li><span>Actively involve community groups</span> and those with subject matter
          expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the <span>relationships</span> and conversations between <span>
            community
            members
          </span>, the <span>local government</span> staff and <span>community partners</span> remain
          <span>respectful, participatory, and productive</span>.</li>
        <li>Provide an environment where people are <span>
            free from discrimination
            or harassment
          </span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Code for San Jose reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of
        these policies not to participate in Code for America network
        activities, events, and digital forums.
      </p>

      <h3>Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>
      <p>
        This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the
        Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other
        volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio
        LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth
        Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner,
        Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the
        policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix,
        Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Code for San Jose network activities, events, and digital forums
        and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an
        anti-harassment policy, included below.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for San
        Jose will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an
        anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to
        offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this guide from
        Code for America.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code for San Jose is dedicated to providing a <span>
          harassment-free
          experience for everyone
        </span> regardless of <span>
          gender, gender identity and
          expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
          size, race, age, or religion
        </span>. <span>
          We do not tolerate harassment of staff,
          presenters, and participants in any form
        </span>. <span>
          Sexual language and imagery
          is not appropriate
        </span> for any Code for America event or network activity,
        including talks. <span>Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled</span>
        from Code for America network activities, events, and digital forums,
        at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Harassment includes but is not limited to:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Offensive verbal or written
            comments related to:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Gender identity and expression</li>
            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
            <li>Disability</li>
            <li>Physical appearance</li>
            <li>Body size</li>
            <li>Race</li>
            <li>Religion</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
          <li>Stalking</li>
          <li>Following</li>
          <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
          <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>Unwarranted exclusion</li>
          <li>Patronizing language or action</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may
        take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
        or expulsion from Code for San Jose network activities, events, and
        digital forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact Code for San Jose Captains
        Annie Steenson, Joseph Richardson and Yan-Yin Choy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants
        contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
        escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
        safe for the duration of the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or
        it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also contact Code for America about harassment at
        safespace@codeforamerica.org and feel free to use the email template
        below. Code for America staff acknowledge that we are not always in a
        position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and
        the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful
        that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community
        that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment
        that is welcoming to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these
        expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
      </p>
