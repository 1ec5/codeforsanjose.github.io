<h1>What We Do</h1>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>

<p>Launched in March 2014, we are a Code for America brigade: a group of volunteers who are passionate about using our skills to advance civic innovation in San Jose. Our members represent a range of skill sets and interests, spanning the high tech, local government and non-profit sectors. Our co-leaders are Kalen Gallagher and Michelle Thong.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>

<p>We promote civic innovation in two main ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>>Civic hacking: Our members develops civic apps, data visualizations and other tools that are useful and inspiring to the San Jose community. We hold twice-monthly civic hack nights and organize quarterly special events such as hackathons.</li>
<li>Policy and advocacy: Our policy team educates community leaders on open data and open government best practices, and advocates for local open data policies.</li>
</ol>
<p>We welcome coders, designers, data geeks, policy wonks and community members of all types with an interest in using technology, creativity and the human spirit to solve real problems.</p>
