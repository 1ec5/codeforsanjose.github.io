## Code for San José


We are a group of volunteer developers, designers, researchers and policy wonks who build civic apps, data visualizations and media projects. 

We create a space for San Jose’s civic tech community to meet, experiment and collaborate on all kinds of projects through our twice-monthly civic hack nights. 

Technical skills are not required to contribute. We need project managers, subject matter experts, communications gurus and community organizers! 


## How to Get Involved

Come to civic hack nights. Find teams to collaborate with. Keep tabs on our schedule by joining our [Meetup group]( https://meetup.com/code-for-san-jose). We typically meet every 2nd and 4th Thursdays 6:30-9:00pm in downtown San José. 

Pitch a design, data or coding project for our volunteers to work on. You can [share your idea](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/Project-Ideas/issues) or email [Michelle Thong, Code for San José Captain](emailto:mthong@gmail.com). 

Share our activities with your friends and colleagues. 
 
Join us on [slack](https://slackin-c4sj.herokuapp.com/) to discuss ideas, projects and colalboration.
